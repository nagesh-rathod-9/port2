## 6.21.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a new `future.v7_relativeSplatPath` flag to implement a breaking bug fix to relative routing when inside a splat route. ([#11087](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11087))

  This fix was originally added in [#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/10983) and was later reverted in [#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078) because it was determined that a large number of existing applications were relying on the buggy behavior (see [#11052](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052))

  **The Bug**
  The buggy behavior is that without this flag, the default behavior when resolving relative paths is to _ignore_ any splat (`*`) portion of the current route path.

  **The Background**
  This decision was originally made thinking that it would make the concept of nested different sections of your apps in `<Routes>` easier if relative routing would _replace_ the current splat:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
  ```

  Any paths like `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/team`, `/dashboard/projects` will match the `Dashboard` route. The dashboard component itself can then render nested `<Routes>`:

  ```jsx
  function Dashboard() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Dashboard Home</Link>
          <Link to="team">Team</Link>
          <Link to="projects">Projects</Link>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
          <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
          <Route path="projects" element={<DashboardProjects />} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Now, all links and route paths are relative to the router above them. This makes code splitting and compartmentalizing your app really easy. You could render the `Dashboard` as its own independent app, or embed it into your large app without making any changes to it.

  **The Problem**

  The problem is that this concept of ignoring part of a path breaks a lot of other assumptions in React Router - namely that `"."` always means the current location pathname for that route. When we ignore the splat portion, we start getting invalid paths when using `"."`:

  ```jsx
  // If we are on URL /dashboard/team, and we want to link to /dashboard/team:
  function DashboardTeam() {
    // ❌ This is broken and results in <a href="/dashboard">
    return <Link to=".">A broken link to the Current URL</Link>;

    // ✅ This is fixed but super unintuitive since we're already at /dashboard/team!
    return <Link to="./team">A broken link to the Current URL</Link>;
  }
  ```

  We've also introduced an issue that we can no longer move our `DashboardTeam` component around our route hierarchy easily - since it behaves differently if we're underneath a non-splat route, such as `/dashboard/:widget`. Now, our `"."` links will, properly point to ourself _inclusive of the dynamic param value_ so behavior will break from it's corresponding usage in a `/dashboard/*` route.

  Even worse, consider a nested splat route configuration:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="dashboard">
        <Route path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
  ```

  Now, a `<Link to=".">` and a `<Link to="..">` inside the `Dashboard` component go to the same place! That is definitely not correct!

  Another common issue arose in Data Routers (and Remix) where any `<Form>` should post to it's own route `action` if you the user doesn't specify a form action:

  ```jsx
  let router = createBrowserRouter({
    path: "/dashboard",
    children: [
      {
        path: "*",
        action: dashboardAction,
        Component() {
          // ❌ This form is broken!  It throws a 405 error when it submits because
          // it tries to submit to /dashboard (without the splat value) and the parent
          // `/dashboard` route doesn't have an action
          return <Form method="post">...</Form>;
        },
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  This is just a compounded issue from the above because the default location for a `Form` to submit to is itself (`"."`) - and if we ignore the splat portion, that now resolves to the parent route.

  **The Solution**
  If you are leveraging this behavior, it's recommended to enable the future flag, move your splat to it's own route, and leverage `../` for any links to "sibling" pages:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="dashboard">
        <Route index path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  function Dashboard() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <nav>
          <Link to="..">Dashboard Home</Link>
          <Link to="../team">Team</Link>
          <Link to="../projects">Projects</Link>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
          <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
          <Route path="projects" element={<DashboardProjects />} />
        </Router>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  This way, `.` means "the full current pathname for my route" in all cases (including static, dynamic, and splat routes) and `..` always means "my parents pathname".

### Patch Changes

- Properly handle falsy error values in ErrorBoundary's ([#11071](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11071))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.14.0`

## 6.20.1

### Patch Changes

- Revert the `useResolvedPath` fix for splat routes due to a large number of applications that were relying on the buggy behavior (see <https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052#issuecomment-1836589329>). We plan to re-introduce this fix behind a future flag in the next minor version. ([#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.13.1`

## 6.20.0

### Minor Changes

- Export the `PathParam` type from the public API ([#10719](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10719))

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug with `resolveTo` in splat routes ([#11045](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11045))
  - This is a follow up to [#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10983) to handle the few other code paths using `getPathContributingMatches`
  - This removes the `UNSAFE_getPathContributingMatches` export from `@remix-run/router` since we no longer need this in the `react-router`/`react-router-dom` layers
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.13.0`

## 6.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `unstable_flushSync` option to `useNavigate`/`useSumbit`/`fetcher.load`/`fetcher.submit` to opt-out of `React.startTransition` and into `ReactDOM.flushSync` for state updates ([#11005](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11005))
- Remove the `unstable_` prefix from the [`useBlocker`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-blocker) hook as it's been in use for enough time that we are confident in the API. We do not plan to remove the prefix from `unstable_usePrompt` due to differences in how browsers handle `window.confirm` that prevent React Router from guaranteeing consistent/correct behavior. ([#10991](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10991))

### Patch Changes

- Fix `useActionData` so it returns proper contextual action data and not _any_ action data in the tree ([#11023](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11023))

- Fix bug in `useResolvedPath` that would cause `useResolvedPath(".")` in a splat route to lose the splat portion of the URL path. ([#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10983))

  - ⚠️ This fixes a quite long-standing bug specifically for `"."` paths inside a splat route which incorrectly dropped the splat portion of the URL. If you are relative routing via `"."` inside a splat route in your application you should double check that your logic is not relying on this buggy behavior and update accordingly.

- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.12.0`

## 6.18.0

### Patch Changes

- Fix the `future` prop on `BrowserRouter`, `HashRouter` and `MemoryRouter` so that it accepts a `Partial<FutureConfig>` instead of requiring all flags to be included. ([#10962](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10962))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.11.0`

## 6.17.0

### Patch Changes

- Fix `RouterProvider` `future` prop type to be a `Partial<FutureConfig>` so that not all flags must be specified ([#10900](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10900))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.10.0`

## 6.16.0

### Minor Changes

- In order to move towards stricter TypeScript support in the future, we're aiming to replace current usages of `any` with `unknown` on exposed typings for user-provided data. To do this in Remix v2 without introducing breaking changes in React Router v6, we have added generics to a number of shared types. These continue to default to `any` in React Router and are overridden with `unknown` in Remix. In React Router v7 we plan to move these to `unknown` as a breaking change. ([#10843](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10843))
  - `Location` now accepts a generic for the `location.state` value
  - `ActionFunctionArgs`/`ActionFunction`/`LoaderFunctionArgs`/`LoaderFunction` now accept a generic for the `context` parameter (only used in SSR usages via `createStaticHandler`)
  - The return type of `useMatches` (now exported as `UIMatch`) accepts generics for `match.data` and `match.handle` - both of which were already set to `unknown`
- Move the `@private` class export `ErrorResponse` to an `UNSAFE_ErrorResponseImpl` export since it is an implementation detail and there should be no construction of `ErrorResponse` instances in userland. This frees us up to export a `type ErrorResponse` which correlates to an instance of the class via `InstanceType`. Userland code should only ever be using `ErrorResponse` as a type and should be type-narrowing via `isRouteErrorResponse`. ([#10811](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10811))
- Export `ShouldRevalidateFunctionArgs` interface ([#10797](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10797))
- Removed private/internal APIs only required for the Remix v1 backwards compatibility layer and no longer needed in Remix v2 (`_isFetchActionRedirect`, `_hasFetcherDoneAnything`) ([#10715](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10715))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.9.0`

## 6.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Add's a new `redirectDocument()` function which allows users to specify that a redirect from a `loader`/`action` should trigger a document reload (via `window.location`) instead of attempting to navigate to the redirected location via React Router ([#10705](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10705))

### Patch Changes

- Ensure `useRevalidator` is referentially stable across re-renders if revalidations are not actively occurring ([#10707](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10707))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.8.0`

## 6.14.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.7.2`

## 6.14.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix loop in `unstable_useBlocker` when used with an unstable blocker function ([#10652](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10652))
- Fix issues with reused blockers on subsequent navigations ([#10656](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10656))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.7.1`

## 6.14.0

### Patch Changes

- Strip `basename` from locations provided to `unstable_useBlocker` functions to match `useLocation` ([#10573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10573))
- Fix `generatePath` when passed a numeric `0` value parameter ([#10612](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10612))
- Fix `unstable_useBlocker` key issues in `StrictMode` ([#10573](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10573))
- Fix `tsc --skipLibCheck:false` issues on React 17 ([#10622](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10622))
- Upgrade `typescript` to 5.1 ([#10581](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10581))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.7.0`

## 6.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Move [`React.startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) usage behind a [future flag](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/guides/api-development-strategy) to avoid issues with existing incompatible `Suspense` usages. We recommend folks adopting this flag to be better compatible with React concurrent mode, but if you run into issues you can continue without the use of `startTransition` until v7. Issues usually boils down to creating net-new promises during the render cycle, so if you run into issues you should either lift your promise creation out of the render cycle or put it behind a `useMemo`. ([#10596](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10596))

  Existing behavior will no longer include `React.startTransition`:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  <RouterProvider router={router} />
  ```

  If you wish to enable `React.startTransition`, pass the future flag to your component:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}>
    <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  <RouterProvider router={router} future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}/>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Work around webpack/terser `React.startTransition` minification bug in production
